# Stellar Wrap - Smart Contract

> **The on-chain Soulbound Token (SBT) registry for Stellar Wrap. This contract stores non-transferable wrap records linked to user addresses, containing data hashes and persona archetypes.**

This repository contains the **Soroban smart contract** that serves as the on-chain anchor for Stellar Wrap. For the full application (frontend, backend, etc.), see the main Stellar Wrap repository.

## 📖 What is Stellar Wrap?

Stellar Wrap is a "Spotify Wrapped"-style experience built specifically for the Stellar community.

Block explorers are great for data, but terrible for stories. Stellar Wrap takes your raw, complex on-chain history—transactions, smart contract deployments, NFT buys—and transforms it into a beautiful, personalized visual story that anyone can understand and share.

By simply connecting your wallet, you get a dynamic snapshot of your month on Stellar, highlighting your achievements and assigning you a unique on-chain persona based on your activity.

**It's more than just stats; it's a tool for builders to prove their contributions and for users to flex their participation in the Stellar ecosystem.**

## 💡 Why We Need This

In Web3, your on-chain history is your resume, your identity, and your reputation. But right now, that reputation is hidden behind confusing transaction hashes.

**Stellar Wrap solves the visibility gap:**

- **For Builders & Developers:** It's hard to showcase the immense value of deploying open-source Soroban contracts. Stellar Wrap makes their code contributions visible and shareable to non-technical users.
- **For the Community:** We lack easy, viral loops to share excitement about what's happening on Stellar. This tool gives everyone a reason to post about their on-chain life on social media.
- **For Users:** It turns isolated transactions into a sense of progress and belonging within the ecosystem.

## 🚀 How the Contract Works

This smart contract provides the on-chain registry for Stellar Wrap records:

1.  **Initialize:** The contract is initialized once with an admin address that has permission to mint wrap records.
2.  **Mint Wrap:** The admin (backend service) calls `mint_wrap()` to create a soulbound record for a user, storing:

- Timestamp of when the wrap was generated
- SHA256 hash of the full off-chain JSON data (ensuring integrity)
- Archetype/persona assigned to the user (e.g., _"soroban_architect"_, _"defi_patron"_, _"diamond_hand"_)

3.  **Query:** Anyone can call `get_wrap()` to retrieve a user's wrap record, enabling verification and display of on-chain personas.
4.  **Soulbound:** Records are non-transferable (SBT), permanently linked to the user's Stellar address.

## 🎯 Key Metrics Tracked

We look beyond simple payments to capture the full spectrum of Stellar's vibrant ecosystem:

- **🧙‍♂️ Soroban Builder Stats:** Contracts deployed and unique user interactions. (Critical for developer reputation!).
- **🤝 dApp Interactions:** Which ecosystem projects did you support the most?
- **🎨 NFT Activity:** New mints collected and top creators supported.
- **💸 Network Volume:** A summary of your general transaction activity.
- **🏆 Your Monthly Persona:** A gamified badge that reflects your unique contribution style.

## Ecosystem Impact

This project is designed to support the growth of the Stellar network by:

1.  **Incentivizing Building:** Publicly celebrating developers who ship code creates positive reinforcement. A "Soroban Architect" badge is a social flex that encourages more building.
2.  **Driving Viral Activity:** Every shared Stellar Wrap card is organic marketing for the blockchain, showing the world that Stellar is active and being used.
3.  **Increasing Retention:** Giving users a personalized summary fosters a sense of ownership and encourages them to come back next month to beat their stats.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The diagram below shows how on-chain and off-chain components interact in the Stellar Wrap system:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Backend as Backend Service
    participant Admin as Admin Key
    participant User as User Wallet
    participant Contract as Soroban Contract
    participant Frontend as Frontend App

    Note over Backend: 1. Generate wrap data
    Backend->>Backend: Analyze user's on-chain activity
    Backend->>Backend: Compute data_hash (SHA256 of JSON)
    Backend->>Backend: Assign archetype persona

    Note over Backend,Admin: 2. Sign with admin key
    Backend->>Admin: Sign(contract_id + user + period + archetype + data_hash)
    Admin-->>Backend: Ed25519 signature

    Note over Backend,User: 3. Deliver to user
    Backend-->>User: signature + period + archetype + data_hash

    Note over User,Contract: 4. User claims on-chain
    User->>Contract: mint_wrap(user, period, archetype, data_hash, signature)
    Contract->>Contract: Verify user auth (require_auth)
    Contract->>Contract: Verify admin signature (ed25519_verify)
    Contract->>Contract: Check no duplicate (Wrap key)
    Contract->>Contract: Store WrapRecord (persistent)
    Contract->>Contract: Update balance & latest period
    Contract-->>User: Event: (mint, user, period) → archetype

    Note over Frontend,Contract: 5. Frontend reads data
    Frontend->>Contract: get_wrap(user, period)
    Contract-->>Frontend: WrapRecord {timestamp, data_hash, archetype, period}
    Frontend->>Contract: balance_of(user)
    Contract-->>Frontend: wrap count
    Frontend->>Frontend: Display persona & stats
```

## 📊 Design Decision: On-Chain `WrapCount` and `balance_of`

**Issue [#40](https://github.com/zintarh/stellar-wrap-contract/issues/40) — Considered removing `WrapCount` storage**

### The trade-off

`WrapCount` is a persistent storage entry incremented on every `mint_wrap` call. This means every mint performs two persistent storage writes (the `WrapRecord` and the `WrapCount`). Since mints also emit events, the count *could* be derived off-chain by indexing those events.

### Decision: **Keep `WrapCount` and `balance_of`**

**Rationale:**

1. **On-chain composability.** `balance_of(user)` allows other Soroban contracts to read a user's wrap count in a single storage read. Removing it would make composability with future on-chain logic impossible without an expensive storage scan.
2. **Predictable cost.** One extra persistent write per mint is a fixed, bounded cost. Lazy counting via storage iteration would be unbounded and far more expensive at query time.
3. **Off-chain indexing is unreliable as a source of truth.** Events are not stored in contract state; an indexer can miss events or be unavailable. On-chain state is the canonical source of truth.

**Alternatives considered and rejected:**

| Option | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| Remove `WrapCount`, derive from events | Breaks on-chain composability; indexer dependency |
| Lazy count (iterate storage) | O(n) cost per query; prohibitively expensive at scale |
| Keep as-is | ✅ **Selected** — fixed cost, composable, canonical |

## 📝 Contract Interface

### Functions

- `initialize(e: Env, admin: Address)` - Initialize contract with admin (callable once)
- `mint_wrap(e: Env, to: Address, data_hash: BytesN<32>, archetype: Symbol)` - Mint a wrap record (admin only)
- `get_wrap(e: Env, user: Address) -> Option<WrapRecord>` - Retrieve a user's wrap record

### Storage

- `WrapRecord`: Contains `timestamp`, `data_hash`, and `archetype`
- `DataKey::Admin`: Stores the admin address
- `DataKey::Wrap(Address)`: Maps user addresses to their wrap records
